  solution, and all of these sets are returned in the partial solution.
  The element is not removed from R (contrary to Christofides) because
  the partial solution already contains this element, and if it was
  removed, the comparision of E==R in set_cover would fail.  The element
  could be removed from R, and the partial solution, and it would then
  have to be removed from the Original_Order_List so that proper matching
  could take place at the conclusion of the program.  This implementation
  seem less cumbersome.

  Set_Partition

  This is the heart of Christofides set partitioning algorithm.  This

  they must come after the initializations, and befor construction of the
  tableau.  The tableau is constructed with a single call to the tableau
  object which knows how to construct itself from a set of weighted sets, F.  
  Next, the current_position_in_block[] array is set up which facilitates
  backtracking through the tableau with the use of the previous_position
  counter.  The first set is selected, and the main loop is entered until
  the next_set function sets the done flag and the loop terminates.  The
  loop takes the next candidate, checks to see if the no-overcovering
  requirement is met, and if it is does a cost test to see if it is
  feasible to be added to the current partial solution.  It should be
  noted that since this is the only test performed, this implementation
  is basically an exhaustive depth-first search of the tableau and
  pruning is not done nearly as often as would be possible with the
  dominance tests Christofides mentions.  These tests could easially be
  included in the if-statment just inside the while loop. Finally when
  the loop is done B_hat and z_hat contain the best solutions to the
  problem and are returned to the main program.

  For better readibility, the following format may be easier to use:

  is also done in this function.  Files saved in this program can be
  read by this program.  Saved files can be used later.  file name can only
  be 20 characters long.  If a longer file name is desired then the user
  can always rename it at a later time outside of the program.

  main

  This is the driver for the scp program.  If it is activated by
  csh> scp in.file.name 
  the in.file.name will be read from instead of prompting the user for
  input.  This file should be in the format provided as a sample and as
  mentioned in the get_R and get_F functions.  Once the input is taken
  in, this program checks if a solution is possible, then calls the
  Set_Cover function which finds the best solution.  When that function
  returns the best solution (which may have been altered by the reduction
  functions of Set_Cover) is printed out along with the best weight.
  Since the sets seen in B_hat may have been altered, a set containing
  the original number of the sets (as input) is provided for the user.
  This set of set numbers, is usually the most helpful information for
  the user since typically they want to know exactly which sets are in
  the solution.
